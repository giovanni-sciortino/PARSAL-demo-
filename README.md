# PARSAL (Pipeline for Automatic Retrieval and Structuring of Academic Literature)

PARSAL is a Python-based system for automated retrieval, downloading, and structuring of scientific literature.
It provides a modern graphical user interface and supports asynchronous downloading from major academic publishers.

**This project was developed as part of my Master’s thesis in collaboration with the Chilab research laboratory in University of Palermo.
The repository is published for portfolio and demonstration purposes, showcasing the architecture and implementation of the system.**

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Multi-Publisher Support:** Search and download articles from:
    *   Elsevier (ScienceDirect)
    *   Springer
    *   Wiley
    *   MDPI
    *   ArXiv
    *   ACL Anthology
*   **GUI:** User-friendly interface built with `customtkinter`, featuring dark mode support, real-time search feedback, and easy selection of articles.
*   **Asynchronous Performance:** Utilizes `asyncio` and `aiohttp` for high-speed, parallel searching and downloading of full-text articles (PDF, XML, JSON).
*   **Advanced Parsing:**
    *   Extracts structured metadata (Title, Authors, Abstract, Keywords, DOI).
    *   **OCR Integration:** Incorporates OCR results (via `olmocr` or raw text) to reconstruct article sections in logical order.
    *   Clean data export to JSON with standardized fields.
*   **Smart Filtering:** Search by keyword and publication year.
